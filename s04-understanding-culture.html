<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 2</span> Understanding Culture</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_p01">When my parents came to the United States in 1979, their world became vastly different than what they had known. Before their arrival, they lived in a small hilltop, tribal village in the mountains of Laos, like many of their ancestors before them. They had the simplest tools for doing their work and for living their lives. The natural world provided everything they needed. If they wanted to use the bathroom, they went outside—not to an outhouse but to the woods. When they were hungry, they cooked the meal in a pot over a large fire pit. When relatives asked them to attend celebrations and notified them that the celebration meal would begin sometime when the sun was to set, my parents knew that the path of the sun would let them know when they should leave their house.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_p02">There were a lot of assumptions my parents made about their world. When they had to relocate to the United States, they found out how different their assumptions were when they were tested in an environment that contradicted their ways of being. They were not aware of a different way of living their lives, because the norms that shaped their lives influenced their actions and behaviors. The norms helped them to learn that what they did was the correct way to live.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_p03">One of their most difficult challenges was to unlearn what they knew in a different context and with different materials and tools that they did not have before. What naturally occurred was a process of culture shock and then a period of acculturation. When my parents’ sponsors showed them how to use the toilet by gesturing what to do and how to flush, my parents were embarrassed. Coming from a culture where modesty is important, they did not know how to respond to the American sponsor’s gestures, yet their embarrassment quickly turned into fascination when they saw how a toilet could dispose of materials.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_p04">Interpreting body language became a critical piece of adaptation and learning. My parents found the exaggerated gestures of their sponsors turning on and off the stove “different.” But it was paying attention to the facial gestures and body language that helped them to understand how to operate a stove. They realized certain things were the same across cultures: taking out a pot to boil water, placing it on a heated surface for the water to boil, taking the pot off the surface to let the water cool. The differences, they noticed, were in the equipment used and the timing of the water boiling. What a surprise it was for them to realize that one could adjust and control temperature!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_p05">As human beings who are accustomed to behaving (consciously and unconsciously) in specific ways, we often do not recognize another perspective until it is presented to us. Ellen Langer,<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_001">Langer (1990).</span> a social psychologist, says that it is in the perspective of another that we learn to see ourselves—to see who we really are. As an educator and facilitator, I meet people in positions of leadership every day who believe that their perspective about culture and how they should work with differences is the right way and that there is no other possibility for a different way of working or thinking. For example, a participant in my training session, Jacob, felt very strongly about the “invasion” (his word, not mine) of immigrants in his neighborhood. As a result, the city he worked for was increasingly diverse and would need to set up services and programs to meet the needs of the new immigrants.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_p06">As a native of the city, Jacob felt strongly that his neighbors needed to assimilate more quickly. As a city employee and manager, he felt excluded that the city would create new services for the immigrants. His issue of conflict here was that he had developed proposals for expanding current services in his department, but they were never approved, mostly because of budgetary reasons. He did not understand why creating “special services for a small population” mattered more than the services for current residents of the city, and he was angry that the funds set aside for the new programming would be large, much larger than his proposed changes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_p07">Jacob, in this example, is bound to his single perspective or viewpoint. He cannot see beyond the situation. And, in fact, when discussing this situation with Jacob and other managers present, other pieces of the story began to unravel. Yes, Jacob had a perspective about immigrants based on his experiences with one immigrant–his neighbor. He used his knowledge and interactions with this person to generalize to an entire population. Additionally, what really mattered to him in his place of work was that he did not feel his ideas mattered. Because every time he proposed changes they were not approved, he took that as a deliberate attack on him. This was not the case at all and he was told this by his peers in the training.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_p08">When Jacob was presented with another perspective, he let his guard down. Over time, he was able to focus on the real issue, which was that no matter what your status, creed, ethnicity, or reason for moving to the United States, as a public sector employee it was his role to provide the appropriate services that would meet the residents’ needs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_p09">As leaders, we must make strong efforts to see a different perspective than what we believe and hold to be true. We must challenge ourselves, as Byron Katie<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_002">Katie (2002).</span> says, by asking whether we know what we see to be true is really, in fact, true. And if it is, how do we know that? What stories have we told ourselves? To understand this, we need to look at the “roots of culture” and how our cultural systems have shaped our realities of the world.</p>

    <h2 class="title editable block">
<span class="title-prefix">2.1</span> Cultural Systems</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s01_p01">Imagine a tree as a metaphor for a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cultural system</a><span class="glossdef">The grouping of a culture’s rituals, traditions, ceremonies, myths, and symbols.</span></span>—all the things that make up who you are. The roots of a tree are essential for the survival of the tree. They carry the nutrients needed for the growth of the tree and store nutrients for later feeding. Roots of trees are generally located in the top 6 to 24 inches of the ground, not too deep from the surface. The roots are impacted by their surrounding, and environmental factors contribute to their health and vitality.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s01_p02">Just like the roots on a tree, cultural systems have roots that are impacted by their surroundings. A culture’s rituals, traditions, ceremonies, myths, and symbols provide it with the nutrients it needs to survive. Environmental factors can change a tree by uprooting it or letting it die off, making space for new life in its place. Similarly, environmental changes impact cultural systems, forcing it to adapt and change to its surroundings or transition into death, creating new cultural stories that carry new life.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s01_p03">But unlike trees and their roots, we get stuck in our cultural systems and do not budge even when our surroundings have changed. Trees, like anything in an ecosystem, have natural cycles of renewal and rebirth. Sometimes this renewal and rebirth is gradual and gentle, while other times it is fast, disruptive, and violent. Trees, because they share their environments with others, will learn to adapt and allow change to occur, no matter what the direction of change may be. Change in their cultural environments is inevitable and a part of the life cycle.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s01_p04">In similar ways, we can think about our cultural systems as part of a larger system. Some cultural anthropologists would describe the cultural systems as “big C” (macroculture) and “little C” (microculture). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">macroculture</a><span class="glossdef">A larger cultural system.</span></span> refers to a larger cultural system, for example, Catholicism is a culture that is not bounded by geography. Within the macroculture of Catholicism are smaller units of culture called <em class="emphasis">subcultures</em>. Change is constant in each cultural system, and transitions, renewal, and rebirth are endless cycles. As cultural shifts occur in the macro- and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">microcultures</a><span class="glossdef">A smaller unit of culture; often referred to as a <em class="emphasis">subculture</em>.</span></span>, small and large, gradual and disruptive, the entire system learns to adapt in different ways.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">2.2</span> What is Culture?</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s02_p01">Definitions of culture cover a wide range of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">perspectives</a><span class="glossdef">Ideas or point of view based on one’s experiences and background.</span></span>. When I ask participants in my business workshops to describe culture, the following are words and phrases they use: <em class="emphasis">food, religion, language, music, region or geography, ethnicity, clothes</em>, and so on. Generally, there is always one person who raises his or her hand timidly and says, “I think culture is more than that. It’s the things we don’t see, like our beliefs or views about gender.” Both are correct—culture represents the things we see, the tangible, as well as the intangible things.</p>
    <div class="figure large editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s02_f01">
        <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 2.1</span> Iceberg Metaphor</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s02_p02">The iceberg, a commonly used metaphor to describe culture, is a great example for illustrating the tangible and the intangible. When talking about culture, most people focus on the “tip of the iceberg,” which is considered as making up 10% of the object. The rest of the iceberg, 90% of it, is below the waterline. Most leaders in businesses, when addressing intercultural situations, pick up on the things they see—things on the “tip of the iceberg.” This means that they never address the cultural issues and problems that are underneath the surface level. Solutions become temporary band-aids covering deeply rooted cultural systems.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s02_p03">I once had a manager describe and define culture as “a monster.” After some laughter from the group, he clarified his statement: “It’s so messy and sometimes it’s too big to handle. And, it’s scary because you don’t know what you’re dealing with.” What he said rings true for many people and businesses that work in multicultural settings. It is certainly not fun to clean up cultural messes, bloopers, or misunderstandings, and when not addressed right away, they can result in large cultural conflicts. The ability to acknowledge one’s cultural mistakes, and having a commitment to learning what culture brings, is a skill that one must have in cultural intelligence work.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s02_p04">This definition of culture as a “monster” is one that looks at culture and its manifestations. Some may even say it is negative and does not paint culture in a positive light. From my experiences working with leaders, defining culture is not about positives or negatives—<em class="emphasis">culture just is</em>, and that is why it can be a challenge to describe it. Definitions of culture usually incorporate an expression of values and beliefs of groups, the learning that occurs in groups, and the expressions of those cultural norms.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s02_p05">The following is a definition of culture that is used in this book and that will be useful in your work:<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_003">This definition of culture has been adapted from Edgar Schein’s definition of culture.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s02_p07">It is helpful if you can think about culture in the following five ways:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s03_p01">Geert Hofstede<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_004">Hofstede (1991).</span> views culture as consisting of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mental programs</a><span class="glossdef">An individual’s patterns of thinking, feeling, and potential acting that have been learned throughout his or her lifetime. Sometimes referred to as <em class="emphasis">softwares of the mind</em> and <em class="emphasis">mental models</em>.</span></span>, calling it <em class="emphasis">softwares of the mind</em>, meaning each person “carries within him or herself patterns of thinking, feeling, and potential acting which were learned throughout their lifetime.”<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_005">Hofstede (1991), p. 4.</span> Similarly, Peter Senge<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_006">Senge (1990), pp. 8–9.</span> argued that mental models lock individuals and groups into a specific perception about the world. Like a computer, we are programmed to act or behave in certain ways. The conscious and unconscious learning we undergo, over time, turns into beliefs that we consider to be valid. We then teach each other that these beliefs are cultural norms, and they are then expressed in our daily lives as behaviors and actions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s03_p02">Think about your first day with your current organization or one you worked for in the past. Typically, your boss or a co-worker gave you an orientation to the company, describing its mission, products, and services. Most likely, you met your co-workers and received a tour of the office facilities. Perhaps you met and talked with co-workers to get a sense of how your job related to their work. Maybe you spent time reading company materials, reviewing your department files, or talking with your supervisor about the details of your job responsibilities. Perhaps you had lunch with other staff members and were told about some parts of the organization such as, “Jane Doe should be fired but is still working here,” “The CEO has control issues,” or “The fax machine breaks down three times a day.” Whatever you did in those first hours or days of orientation and training, you created an image of how you would fit into the company. In that moment, you told yourself a story of how you would work with the company and how it would work with you because others in that business culture told you how you needed to behave. This moment is so powerful that it shapes your experiences, including your thoughts, actions, behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes for the rest of your time with the company.</p>

Although she gets along with members of her department and team, she tends to spend her free time with other colleagues who are of Asian descent, especially those who are in her generation.

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s04_p03">These two examples describe culture as a shared learning experience. Although you may think of yourself as an individual, you share beliefs, rituals, ceremonies, traditions, and assumptions with people who grew up or live in similar cultural backgrounds. It is easier for you to relate to someone who has shared value systems and ways of doing things than someone who does not share the same values.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s04_p04">The patterns of culture bind us together and enable us to get along with each other. Even though it feels good to be around people who think, act, and behave as you, shared learning can create blind spots. Shared cultures create a dynamic of an in-group, where people segregate themselves from each other. Within teams in organizations, in-group blind spots can lead to “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">group think</a><span class="glossdef">A group dynamic in which the pattern of thinking conforms to the group’s values.</span></span>,” a term coined by Irving Janis<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_007">Janis (1973), pp. 19–25.</span> to explain the ways in which groups ignore alternative solutions and take on actions and behaviors that discount the experiences for others.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">2.5</span> Culture is Dynamic</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s05_p01">Culture is dynamic and thus complex. Culture is fluid rather than static, which means that culture changes all the time, every day, in subtle and tangible ways. Because humans communicate and express their cultural systems in a variety of ways, it can be hard to pinpoint exactly what cultural dynamics are at play. Consider, for example, a conversation about a person’s attitude or feelings. In this type of conversation, Albert Meharbian<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_008">Meharbian (1971).</span> found that people pay attention to (a) the words, or what is being said; (b) the tone, or how the words are said; and (c) the visual behind the words, often called the body language. All of these are aspects of culture that are interpreted differently depending on the cultural context. Add multiple layers of culture to the conversation—such as time, power and authority, emotion, age, gender, religion, nationality, and even previous intercultural interactions—and communication at a cross-cultural level becomes complex and hard to manage. The following is an example of the dynamism of cultures:</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s05_n01">
        <p class="para" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s05_p02">Sheila is the director of marketing for a social services agency. She provides feedback to one of her managers about how to improve services. Sheila sits behind a large executive desk and is leaning forward. The employee sits with her arms crossed, leaning away from Sheila.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s05_p03">If you were observing this scene, are you able to tell from the body language what each person is thinking? Why or why not? What cultural factors might be present?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s05_p04">In the example, Sheila’s body language can be interpreted as any of the following: eager to assist or help, intensely interested in what the employee has to say, aggressive and wanting more information, or needing deeper engagement in the conversation. Her employee’s body language could mean any of the following: protective, suspicious, not caring, or relaxed. To understand the dynamics of culture in this example, you would need to pay attention to the things you do not see such as:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s05_l01">
        <li> Is Sheila older or younger than her employee?</li>

<span class="title-prefix">2.6</span> Culture is Systemic</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s06_p01">In systems theory, systems are interrelated, interconnected parts that create a whole. There are patterns of behavior, deeply rooted structural systems, which are beneath the waterline. What we see at the top of the iceberg are the behaviors; we do not see what contributes to those behaviors. Consider, for example, a white woman walking down a quiet street. She quickly clutches her handbag closer to her body as she passes a black man. Then, when she spots a white man walking toward her, she loosens her hold on the purse.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s06_p02">To address the system, one must be able to address the underlining patterns. These patterns, because they are deeply embedded in the system, will take up significant effort, time, and resources. Changes to the system are slow and gradual; visible changes may not appear until months, or even years, later.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s06_p03">Because most leaders spend their time evaluating and finding solutions to an “event,” they revisit the issues over and over again, with no positive and sustainable results. The following case study illustrates the systemic nature of culture:</p>

A look at the structural patterns reveals a more complex issue that cannot be solved through training and career fairs. The structural pattern is an insidious belief that women enter the law profession with the same opportunities and access to practicing law as men in the firm. Underlining this belief are more patterns of thought that keep this structural pattern in place. Possible patterns of thought could be:</p>

This group of leaders has a team culture that orients itself toward a democratic process: decision making is based on one vote from each member. Now imagine a similar group of leaders with the same task but, this time, the group of leaders is comprised of Native Americans. Leaders who are younger in the group ask their elders for advice. This is an example of how cultural systems differ in their interpretation and expressions of culture. In some cultural systems, voting is not an option. The symbol of a <em class="emphasis">vote</em> has different meanings and interpretations—or simply may not even exist in any practical sense—depending on the cultural background.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s08_p01">One of the things that can happen in the context of discussing culture is falling into the stereotypes and generalizations of a cultural group or norm. It is important to recognize the difference and the impact these factors have in cultural interactions. In general, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stereotypes</a><span class="glossdef">Statements and interpretations, usually negative, made about a group of people which limit that group to specific perspectives.</span></span> are negative statements and interpretations made about a group of people. Stereotypes, whether deemed positive or negative, place people into boxes and categories and limit them to those specific perspectives. A stereotype, such as “Asians are good at math,” does not provide the complete picture someone needs to understand the Asian culture or the differences between Asian cultures. Similarly, just because you meet a 70-year old who does not know how to use current technology, it does not mean that other individuals in that generation do not know how to use it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s08_p02">By contrast, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">generalizations</a><span class="glossdef">Broad statements, either valid or faulty, that are based on facts, experiences, examples, or logic.</span></span> of cultures are broad statements based on facts, experiences, examples, or logic. There are two kinds of generalizations, valid and faulty, and it is your role to determine which generalizations have validity behind them. Broad characterization of cultural groups can serve as a framework for cultural interactions. For example, Hispanic societies have a high degree of machismo, or, in Middle Eastern cultures, women have a lesser status than men—these types of generalizations are helpful when engaging with people of those cultures. But in all cultural interactions, culturally intelligent leadership requires you to recognize that generalizations do not apply to everyone within a cultural group.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">2.9</span> Levels of Culture</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s09_p01">One of the basic tenets of culture is that it consists of levels and sublevels. It is useful to think about culture in terms of five basic levels: national, regional, organizational, team, and individual. Within each of these levels are tangible and intangible sublevels of culture.</p>

            <p class="para" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s09_s01_p01">A businesswoman from the United States is in Germany for contract negotiations between her employer and a large German bank. The meeting is scheduled for nine o’clock in the morning. When she arrives to the meeting a few minutes before its start time, she is amazed that all her German counterparts are already seated and ready to begin the meeting. A few days later, upon her arrival back to the United States, she remarks to her American colleagues her experience with German culture. In particular, she notes their level of attentiveness to punctuality and planning and says, “I thought we were punctual here in the U.S.! It’s nothing compared to how Germans view punctuality.”</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s09_s01_p02">This example illustrates the national differences between two cultures: American and German. National differences refer to the cultural influences of a nation that result in its national characteristics. Although nation-states have regional and political differences, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">national culture</a><span class="glossdef">The values, largely unconscious and developed throughout childhood, that are held by a majority of the population within a nation.</span></span> can be viewed as the values held by a majority of the population within the nation. These values are largely unconscious and developed throughout one’s childhood. The values are pushed to a level of consciousness when in contrast to another nation’s cultural values.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s09_s01_p03">Within national cultures, values are generally seen as stable over time. National values, because they reflect the traditions of the nation-state over time, will change slightly from generation to generation, but the overall values will remain the same. For example, a German who comes from a culture of punctuality and travels for business in Italy will notice a national cultural difference in how Italians view time (more leisurely and relaxed) as compared to their own national culture.</p>

When I attended college in Boston, I heard the expression “wicked” used quite often. After asking my New England friends what “wicked” meant, I learned that it was used to emphasize a point. If I attended a concert that I really enjoyed, I would say, “That concert was awesome!” New Englanders would say, “That concert was wicked awesome.” After living in the Boston area for 4 years, the word became a part of my vocabulary. When I used the word in conversations with my friends and family members in Minnesota, they did not understand what I meant.</p>

Bao’s mother passed away while she was very young and she was raised by her father and aunts. Her father was not around because of long work hours. Bao, with the help of her aunts, raised her younger siblings. Her mother’s death was a significant event in her life as she felt she did not have the mother-daughter relationship that many of her peers did. As a result she is overly protective.</p>

Not everyone acts or behaves the same in a national culture such as the United States. There are regional, county, and city differences within the national culture of being an “American.” There are religious differences as well as gender cultures, ability and disability cultures, cultures revolving around sexual orientation, and even cultures centered around concepts or states of being, for example, the culture of homelessness or the culture of juvenile delinquency.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_p01">Cultures show up in many forms and are expressed differently. Yet all forms and levels of cultures express and share three fundamental aspects: values, assumptions, and symbols.</p>
    <div class="section" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Values</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p01">You need to recognize that value systems are fundamental to understanding how culture expresses itself. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Values</a><span class="glossdef">Principles that guide individuals in their behaviors and actions.</span></span> often serve as principles that guide people in their behaviors and actions. Our values, ideally, should match up with what we say we will do, and our values are most evident in symbolic forms. Consider, for example, a picture of the American flag. If you were an American, what words do the pictures evoke for you? <em class="emphasis">Freedom, liberty, America, united, independence, democracy</em>, or <em class="emphasis">patriotism</em>, perhaps?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p02">What if a Nazi symbol were painted on the American flag? How would that make you feel? <em class="emphasis">Disgusted, sad, angry, revengeful</em>? What would the desecration of the flag symbolize? <em class="emphasis">Hatred, terrorism, nationalism</em>? What about <em class="emphasis">freedom of speech</em>? Symbols like the American flag evoke strong emotions for people, and when the symbol is desecrated, it can feel like a personal attack on the person’s value system and their beliefs about the world. It feels out of alignment from what we believe to be true—what we see as our reality of the world. This is because our values and beliefs are rooted in stories we tell ourselves over and over again.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p03">Joseph Campbell<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_009">Campbell (1988).</span> noted that stories and myths are our psychological maps of the world. We use them to guide our thinking and behaviors, and when we do not like a story or it does not align with stories we know, we discard them. We learn through culture to create a story about the story. Campbell said that when we can unravel our stories, we begin to see the meaning we have placed on them and the impact they have on our lives. The case study that follows illustrates this notion of values:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_n01">

Working extra hours every week helps him bring home more income for his family of four. He will do whatever it takes to help take care of his family. Ana is also a manager in the same restaurant. She works her forty hours a week and then goes home to her family of three. She doesn’t want to work more hours because she wants to spend as much time with her family as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p05">How does James’s perspective of family differ from Ana’s? What assumptions does each have about the value of <em class="emphasis">family</em>? What might be the stories they are creating for themselves that shape their values of family? Both individuals have the same value of <em class="emphasis">family</em>, but their values are expressed differently through their behaviors. A value such as family can be expressed and thought of differently from one culture to the next or from one person to the next. James believes that working hard illustrates his value of family, while Ana believes that spending time with her family demonstrates her commitment to the value. These assumptions are not expressed verbally, and, in some cases, the assumptions can be unconscious. Notice how, in the following scenario, James’ assumptions are challenged:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_n02">
            <p class="para" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p06">Both Ana and James receive a bonus for their work. James finds out that Ana has received the same percentage of bonus that he has. He’s quite upset because he knows that he works more than she does and sometimes covers her shifts when she has family emergencies or is late because of day care issues. He thinks to himself, “How could she get the same bonus as me? She doesn’t even work that hard and she comes in late to her shift using excuses that her day care didn’t show up again.”</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p07">In the case study, the assumptions that James has of Ana (Ana makes excuses; Ana comes in late; or Ana does not work hard) can become a problem and conflict between the two. His assumptions are based on his own definition of family, which could consist of any of the following: be responsible, show up on time, or working hard can bring in more money for the family. His assumptions are challenged when Ana receives the same bonus for a perceived different level of commitment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p08">As a leader, it is important to understand and identify to employees that most of us share the same values. It is our interpretation and expression of the values that creates the conflict.

They are beliefs or ideas that we believe and hold to be true. They come about through repetition. This repetition becomes a habit we form and leads to habitual patterns of thinking and doing.

They define for us, and give life or meaning to, objects, people, places, and things in our lives. Our assumptions about our world determine how we react emotionally and what actions we need to take. The assumptions about our world views guide our behaviors and shape our attitudes. Consider, for example, the following case study:</p>

He said that people use symbols to define their world and express their emotions. As human beings, we all learn, both consciously and unconsciously, starting at a very young age. What we internalize comes through observation, experience, interaction, and what we are taught. We manipulate symbols to create meaning and stories that dictate our behaviors, to organize our lives, and to interact with others. The meanings we attach to symbols are arbitrary. Looking someone in the eye means that you are direct and respectful in some countries, yet, in other cultural systems, looking away is a sign of respect. The meanings we attach to symbols can create a cultural havoc when we meet someone who believes in a different meaning or interpretation; it can give us <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">culture shock</a><span class="glossdef">A state of distress or confusion experienced when an individual is unprepared for a cultural situation or environment.</span></span>. This shock can be disorientating, confusing, or surprising. It can bring on anxiety or nervousness, and, for some, a sense of losing control.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s03_p02">While training senior managers in a leadership program, the issue of the organization’s dress code came up in our conversation about differences. All the managers were in agreement that there was a dress code problem. It seemed to the managers that a couple of the employees were not abiding by the dress code policy. At this mid-size organization, the dress code was business casual, but a couple of the employees (the younger ones to be exact) came into work wearing t-shirts or dresses with thin straps. The managers were all confused as to why the dress code was so hard to follow for these two employees. It was obvious to them that business casual meant looking professional and neat, wearing clothes that were pressed and crisp. No matter how many times the dress code was explained to the staff, these two employees never changed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s03_p03">In the training, we deconstructed the issue to understand what was really at play. The managers recognized that the dress code of “business casual” could mean several things if not explicitly stated in the policy. In fact, one manager said, “We keep saying that business casual is common sense, but our idea of common sense could be completely different from that employee’s version of common sense.” They also discovered that they did not want to be so explicit as to name every article of clothing that employees could and could not wear. They felt that being explicit would take away the feeling or the symbol that the office was a casual and relaxed environment; having policies that dictated everything that someone could or could not do would symbolize a different type of working environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s03_p04">As a result of this conversation, the managers recognized the tangible ways in which symbols are manifested in organizations. They became more mindful of the language and words used. They were more intentional about their behavior, now recognizing that each of their reactions or non-reactions is a symbol.</p>

In many cultural systems, holding on to traditions is important in current day-to-day operations and relationships. Some societies will refer to traditions to preserve and maintain cultural norms, that is, to protect what currently exists.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s11_s05_p02">Time is also a reference to a culture’s orientation toward tasks or relationships. For example, a manager from the United States who travels to India to negotiate a business contract needs to know that meetings will occur whenever people show up to the meeting, which could be hours after it is scheduled. A task-oriented leader is certain to be frustrated when he meets up with an Indian who is more time-oriented toward relationships. In the American perspective, promptness is professionalism; yet, in the other perspective, the concept of time is more loose and flexible. The value of time is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#moua_1.0-ch02_s11_s05_f01">Figure 2.9 "Time Value Dimension"</a>.</p>

Like other cultural systems, organizational culture controls the behavior, values, assumptions, and beliefs of organizational members. It is a combination of organizational members’ <em class="emphasis">own</em> beliefs and the values, beliefs, and assumptions of the organization.

        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s12_s02_p04">Business leaders have tremendous power to change the organizational culture by utilizing several methods that address the underlying assumptions, beliefs, and values of its members; however, this is not an easy task. Culture, as explained, is oftentimes manifest in unconscious behaviors, values, and assumptions that develop over time and change as new employees enter an organization. The significance of the GLOBE study is that it helps leaders to understand the role of culture in leadership. By understanding one’s culture, as well as that of others, it brings you to awareness of different perceptions of leadership and how cultures come to understand leaders. Recognizing the elements in leadership and culture enables you to leverage the differences that cultures create and to use that to create positive intercultural growth.</p>

        <li> Culture is comprised of both tangible and intangible things you see, hear, feel, and perceive. It consists of the shared beliefs, values, and assumptions of a group of people who learn from one another and teach to others that their behaviors, attitudes, and perspectives are the correct ways to think, act, and feel.</li>
        <li> Culture is a process of learning and sharing, and it is dynamic and symbolic.</li>
        <li> Cultural issues are systemic and understanding this helps leaders to appreciate culture in its fullest sense.</li>
        <li> Awareness helps to eliminate the stereotypes that are derived from cultural misunderstandings, which limit the positive ways in which culture is viewed. However, generalizations about cultures can help serve as a framework for interacting with unfamiliar cultural systems.</li>
        <li> Culture is multidimensional, consisting of multiple layers. There are five main levels—national, regional, organizational, team, and individual—that are most useful in cultural contexts.</li>
        <li> Each cultural layer, when peeled apart, reveals the “roots” of culture, which consist of the values, assumptions, and symbols of the culture. These three ground cultural systems, often making it hard for cultural shifts to occur.</li>
        <li> Familiarity with Hofstede’s model of value dimensions (identity, power, gender, uncertainty, and time) in the workplace helps leaders to realize the impact of values and beliefs in cultural settings.</li>
        <li> The GLOBE study of 62 societies is the most comprehensive research, to date, that analyzes how leadership is perceived by cultures.</li>
        <li> Nine cultural value dimensions, including the five proposed by Hofstede in the 1980s, illustrate the importance of understanding value dimensions in the context of leading.</li>
        <li> There are six global leadership categories that emerged from the GLOBE data: charismatic, team-oriented, participative, humane-oriented, autonomous, and self-protective.</li>
        <li> The GLOBE data points to universally positive and undesirable attributes of leaders. All cultures agree that the following are negative attributes: a leader who is a loner, irritable, ruthless, asocial, nonexplicit, dictatorial, noncooperative, and egocentric.</li>
        <li> Leaders have a role in creating business cultures that make employees feel valued and included regardless of their cultural backgrounds.</li>
