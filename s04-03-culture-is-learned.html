<span class="title-prefix">2.3</span> Culture is Learned</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s03_p01">Geert Hofstede<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_004">Hofstede (1991).</span> views culture as consisting of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mental programs</a><span class="glossdef">An individual’s patterns of thinking, feeling, and potential acting that have been learned throughout his or her lifetime. Sometimes referred to as <em class="emphasis">softwares of the mind</em> and <em class="emphasis">mental models</em>.</span></span>, calling it <em class="emphasis">softwares of the mind</em>, meaning each person “carries within him or herself patterns of thinking, feeling, and potential acting which were learned throughout their lifetime.”<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_005">Hofstede (1991), p. 4.</span> Similarly, Peter Senge<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_006">Senge (1990), pp. 8–9.</span> argued that mental models lock individuals and groups into a specific perception about the world. Like a computer, we are programmed to act or behave in certain ways. The conscious and unconscious learning we undergo, over time, turns into beliefs that we consider to be valid. We then teach each other that these beliefs are cultural norms, and they are then expressed in our daily lives as behaviors and actions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s03_p02">Think about your first day with your current organization or one you worked for in the past. Typically, your boss or a co-worker gave you an orientation to the company, describing its mission, products, and services. Most likely, you met your co-workers and received a tour of the office facilities. Perhaps you met and talked with co-workers to get a sense of how your job related to their work. Maybe you spent time reading company materials, reviewing your department files, or talking with your supervisor about the details of your job responsibilities. Perhaps you had lunch with other staff members and were told about some parts of the organization such as, “Jane Doe should be fired but is still working here,” “The CEO has control issues,” or “The fax machine breaks down three times a day.” Whatever you did in those first hours or days of orientation and training, you created an image of how you would fit into the company. In that moment, you told yourself a story of how you would work with the company and how it would work with you because others in that business culture told you how you needed to behave. This moment is so powerful that it shapes your experiences, including your thoughts, actions, behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes for the rest of your time with the company.</p>
