    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch01_s03_l01">
        <li> Culturally intelligent leaders are change-focused and change-ready. They anticipate different scenarios for change and enable their organizations and people to embrace change.</li>
        <li> Many leadership scholars differentiate between management and leadership and managers and leaders.</li>
        <li> Managers are responsible for controlling, coordinating, planning, and organizing. Leaders are people who inspire, motivate, unite people, and create visions for the future.</li>
        <li> Cultural intelligence requires leadership and leaders, not management and managers.</li>
        <li> Historically, leadership theories and frameworks are based on Western ideologies and perspectives.</li>
        <li> Leadership theories and frameworks must incorporate a global perspective that considers differences in perceptions of leadership and leaders.</li>
        <li> Leaders must be able to create cultures where differences thrive. They may accomplish this by: making diversity a priority, getting to know people and their differences, enabling trust, holding each person accountable for differences, and establishing mutual interdependence.</li>
        <li> Leadership and culture are intertwined like two halves of a rope threaded together. At times, leaders must be able to step away from what they are experiencing to understand the full impact of culture on leadership.</li>
