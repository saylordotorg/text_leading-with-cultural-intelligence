A manager’s behavior and activities focus on controlling, planning, coordinating, and organizing.

It calls for what Ronald Heifetz<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn01_005">Taylor (1999).</span> defines as courageous leadership, that is, the courage to see reality and help others see their realities: the realities of who they are, how they behave, what talents and skill sets they have or are missing in this global world, and what opportunities should be capitalized upon and seized. Leaders must be able to see and anticipate what skill sets are needed in the future, not just develop their employees’ skills for the moment.<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn01_006">Goldsmith (2006).</span></p>

Barry Salzberg, CEO of Deloitte, says that organizations and leaders must ask themselves the hard questions: Does our corporate culture really accept the differences it invites, and do we really embrace the different perspectives that come from increasing our commitment to recruiting?<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn01_007">Salzberg (2008), p. 123.</span> This type of perspective demands leaders who work toward transformation, or what Couto calls <em class="emphasis">citizen leaders</em>, “transforming leaders who engage others in efforts to reach higher levels of human awareness and relationships.”<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn01_008">Couto (1995).</span></p>
