<span class="title-prefix">5.1</span> What is Self-Efficacy?</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch05_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Self-efficacy</a><span class="glossdef">An individual’s perceptions of his or her abilities to meet a personal goal he or she has set.</span></span>, as defined by Albert Bandura,<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn05_001">Bandura (1974).</span> represents your perception of your abilities to meet a goal you have set for yourself. It is similar to self-confidence. Self-efficacy is a foundational component in cultural intelligence. For the past 25 years, scholars have researched this topic and the strategies that leaders can use to encourage higher levels of efficacy in their employees.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch05_s01_p02">People with lower self-efficacy will have challenges throughout intercultural processes because they do not believe that they will be able to solve the problem. They do not feel they have the skills needed to work through the issues. Conversely, leaders who have higher levels of self-efficacy believe they can overcome obstacles, whether difficult or not. They have an easier time engaging in problem solving and finding strategic approaches for solving the issues before them.</p>
