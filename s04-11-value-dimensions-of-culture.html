    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s11_p01">The work of Geert Hofstede,<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_011">Hofstede (2001).</span> while employed at IBM in the late 1960s to early 1970s, still stands as one of the most comprehensive studies of cultural values on leadership in the workplace. From his data collected from over 30 countries and 100,000 individuals, Hofstede created a model of value dimensions that speak to the ways that cultures tend to operate. Although this study is generalized to specific countries, his work on cultural value dimensions is helpful to any business doing global and multicultural work.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s11_p02">According to Hofstede, the five main dimensions are <em class="emphasis">identity, power, gender, uncertainty</em>, and <em class="emphasis">time</em>. You can think about cultural value dimensions on a scale or a continuum, where one aspect of the value lies on one side of the scale and the other extreme lies at the other end of the scale.</p>

These dimensions provide you with a perspective of culture for yourself as well as a perspective of how others perceive their culture. All cultures experience these dimensions of difference in many ways, and different cultures solve these differences in many ways. Becoming aware of these concepts helps you to figure out the experiences you have in relation to your culture. It helps to make that experience less ambiguous and threatening. Cultural value dimensions provide clarity and a starting place for cultural awareness. However, they are often seen as intangible and under the waterline, but once you adapt to the cultural dimensions, you become more comfortable and do not see the cultural difference.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s11_s01_p02">On one spectrum, there is an expectation of doing things for the group rather than for oneself. On the other side, achievements and needs are individualized. Hofstede<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_012">Hofstede (2001).</span> found that cultures placing a high value on individualism and a low value on collectivism valued individual rights; cultures placing a high value on collectivism valued relationships and harmony. This orientation, he argued, can have a large affect on managing organizations and people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s11_s01_p03">For example, in many Latino cultures, the concept of family, <em class="emphasis">la familia</em>, is critical to their cultural history and social systems. <em class="emphasis">La familia</em> is the most important social unit and includes extended family members. Decision making, conflict resolution, and negotiation are based on group needs rather than individual preferences; through paying attention to group and collective needs, harmony and relationships are intact. Alternatively, in individualistic cultures, the need of the individual comes first. U.S. culture teaches this to children at a young age. The following is an example that illustrates the differences between <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">individualist</a><span class="glossdef">A type of culture that places importance on decision making, conflict resolution, and negotiation based on individual preferences rather than group needs; personal disclosure; and individual achievements and needs.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">collectivist cultures</a><span class="glossdef">A type of culture that places importance on decision making, conflict resolution, and negotiation based on group needs rather than individual preferences; doing things for the group rather than for one’s self; a lack of personal disclosure; group public image in social contexts; and maintaining relationships.</span></span>:</p>

In regard to leadership, power dimension can also represent a culture’s tendencies toward authority, on one end, and one’s orientation toward laissez-faire leadership, on the other. Hofstede found that low-power-distance cultures emphasized equality and minimized power and status. The following is an example of this:</p>

Gender refers to the culture’s tendencies or orientation toward enforcing or reinforcing masculine and feminine roles in work. Masculine cultures tend to emphasize ambition, control, competition, assertiveness, and achievement, whereas feminine cultures emphasize nurture, care, sharing, quality of life, and relationships. Sometimes these values are expressed as the “quantity of life” and the “quality of life.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s11_s03_p02">In his findings, Hofstede indicated that cultures that rate high in masculinity, such as Japan, Austria, Venezuela, and Italy, revealed a high proportion of males in dominant structures; in low masculine cultures, such as Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, and Sweden, women were treated more equally in their social systems.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s11_s03_p03">It is important that you recognize that these values are not associated with being male or female.

Edward Hall<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_015">Hall (1981).</span> popularized the terms “high-text” culture and “low-text” culture to describe cultural differences between two different types of societies.

        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s11_s04_p03">High-context cultures are societies in which people often make inferences; they leave things unsaid, knowing that the other person would understand what was implied in the communication. People in these societies tend to rely on groups for support. Low-context cultures are societies that are explicit and direct in their communication. They generally are more comfortable relying on themselves, as individuals, and working out solutions to problems. Like high-context cultures, relationships are important to low-context societies; the difference is in the longevity of the relationships. Generally, low-context societies have many relationships that are less intimate and close than those of high-context cultures.</p>

In many cultural systems, holding on to traditions is important in current day-to-day operations and relationships. Some societies will refer to traditions to preserve and maintain cultural norms, that is, to protect what currently exists.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s11_s05_p02">Time is also a reference to a culture’s orientation toward tasks or relationships. For example, a manager from the United States who travels to India to negotiate a business contract needs to know that meetings will occur whenever people show up to the meeting, which could be hours after it is scheduled. A task-oriented leader is certain to be frustrated when he meets up with an Indian who is more time-oriented toward relationships. In the American perspective, promptness is professionalism; yet, in the other perspective, the concept of time is more loose and flexible. The value of time is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#moua_1.0-ch02_s11_s05_f01">Figure 2.9 "Time Value Dimension"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s11_s05_p03">Understanding these five value dimensions and their impact in different cultural systems will be helpful to your work in cultural intelligence. Like any cultural model, you need to recognize that cultural factors in leadership and organizations, as indicated by Taylor Cox, differ “across gender, nationality, and racial/ethnic groups as it relates to time and space orientation, leadership style orientations, individualism versus collectivism, competitive versus cooperative behavior, locus of control, and communication styles.”<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_016">Cox (1994), p. 108.</span> You must recognize that <em class="emphasis">microcultures</em> exist within <em class="emphasis">macrocultures</em>; this is significant in working effectively on a cross-cultural level.<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_017">Cox (1994), p. 106.</span></p>
