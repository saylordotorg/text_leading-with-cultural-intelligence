<span class="title-prefix">2.10</span> The Roots of Culture</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_p01">Cultures show up in many forms and are expressed differently. Yet all forms and levels of cultures express and share three fundamental aspects: values, assumptions, and symbols.</p>
    <div class="section" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Values</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p01">You need to recognize that value systems are fundamental to understanding how culture expresses itself. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Values</a><span class="glossdef">Principles that guide individuals in their behaviors and actions.</span></span> often serve as principles that guide people in their behaviors and actions. Our values, ideally, should match up with what we say we will do, and our values are most evident in symbolic forms. Consider, for example, a picture of the American flag. If you were an American, what words do the pictures evoke for you? <em class="emphasis">Freedom, liberty, America, united, independence, democracy</em>, or <em class="emphasis">patriotism</em>, perhaps?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p02">What if a Nazi symbol were painted on the American flag? How would that make you feel? <em class="emphasis">Disgusted, sad, angry, revengeful</em>? What would the desecration of the flag symbolize? <em class="emphasis">Hatred, terrorism, nationalism</em>? What about <em class="emphasis">freedom of speech</em>? Symbols like the American flag evoke strong emotions for people, and when the symbol is desecrated, it can feel like a personal attack on the person’s value system and their beliefs about the world. It feels out of alignment from what we believe to be true—what we see as our reality of the world. This is because our values and beliefs are rooted in stories we tell ourselves over and over again.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p03">Joseph Campbell<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_009">Campbell (1988).</span> noted that stories and myths are our psychological maps of the world. We use them to guide our thinking and behaviors, and when we do not like a story or it does not align with stories we know, we discard them. We learn through culture to create a story about the story. Campbell said that when we can unravel our stories, we begin to see the meaning we have placed on them and the impact they have on our lives. The case study that follows illustrates this notion of values:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p04">James works full-time managing a fast food restaurant chain. Working extra hours every week helps him bring home more income for his family of four. He will do whatever it takes to help take care of his family. Ana is also a manager in the same restaurant. She works her forty hours a week and then goes home to her family of three. She doesn’t want to work more hours because she wants to spend as much time with her family as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p05">How does James’s perspective of family differ from Ana’s? What assumptions does each have about the value of <em class="emphasis">family</em>? What might be the stories they are creating for themselves that shape their values of family? Both individuals have the same value of <em class="emphasis">family</em>, but their values are expressed differently through their behaviors. A value such as family can be expressed and thought of differently from one culture to the next or from one person to the next. James believes that working hard illustrates his value of family, while Ana believes that spending time with her family demonstrates her commitment to the value. These assumptions are not expressed verbally, and, in some cases, the assumptions can be unconscious. Notice how, in the following scenario, James’ assumptions are challenged:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_n02">
            <p class="para" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p06">Both Ana and James receive a bonus for their work. James finds out that Ana has received the same percentage of bonus that he has. He’s quite upset because he knows that he works more than she does and sometimes covers her shifts when she has family emergencies or is late because of day care issues. He thinks to himself, “How could she get the same bonus as me? She doesn’t even work that hard and she comes in late to her shift using excuses that her day care didn’t show up again.”</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p07">In the case study, the assumptions that James has of Ana (Ana makes excuses; Ana comes in late; or Ana does not work hard) can become a problem and conflict between the two. His assumptions are based on his own definition of family, which could consist of any of the following: be responsible, show up on time, or working hard can bring in more money for the family. His assumptions are challenged when Ana receives the same bonus for a perceived different level of commitment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s01_p08">As a leader, it is important to understand and identify to employees that most of us share the same values. It is our interpretation and expression of the values that creates the conflict. Many people justify bias and discrimination on the grounds of “values” without realizing that it is not the values themselves but the difference between our expression and interpretation and that of those we come into conflict with.</p>

    <div class="section" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Assumptions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s02_p01">Our values are supported by our <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">assumptions</a><span class="glossdef">Beliefs and ideas that individuals believe and hold to be true.</span></span> of our world. They are beliefs or ideas that we believe and hold to be true. They come about through repetition. This repetition becomes a habit we form and leads to habitual patterns of thinking and doing. We do not realize our assumptions because they are ingrained in us at an unconscious level. We are aware of it when we encounter a value or belief that is different from ours, when it makes us feel that we need to stand up for, or validate, our beliefs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s02_p02">In the iceberg analogy, assumptions are underneath the waterline. They define for us, and give life or meaning to, objects, people, places, and things in our lives. Our assumptions about our world determine how we react emotionally and what actions we need to take. The assumptions about our world views guide our behaviors and shape our attitudes. Consider, for example, the following case study:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s02_n01">
            <p class="para" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s02_p03">Kong grows up in SE Asia and has seen only males in leadership roles. Once he moves to the U.S., he assumes males are the only authority figures. Meanwhile his daughters, Sheng and Lia, who have grown up in the U.S. and were raised with access to education and resources learn that they can be leaders. In their professional work they are seen by their peers as leaders.</p>
            <p class="para" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s02_p04">One day, at a celebration event that Sheng brings him to, Kong meets a White man who is her supervisor. He tells Kong, “Your daughter is a great leader. She’s really helped us through this transition.” He replies politely, “Thank you.” Later, Kong shares with his wife, Ka, the story. He says, “I don’t know why he thinks Sheng is a leader. Women are not leaders. Only men are leaders.”</p>

    <div class="section" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Symbols</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s03_p01">Anthropologist Clifford Geertz<span class="footnote" id="moua_1.0-fn02_010">Geertz (1973).</span> believed that culture was a system based on symbols. He said that people use symbols to define their world and express their emotions. As human beings, we all learn, both consciously and unconsciously, starting at a very young age. What we internalize comes through observation, experience, interaction, and what we are taught. We manipulate symbols to create meaning and stories that dictate our behaviors, to organize our lives, and to interact with others. The meanings we attach to symbols are arbitrary. Looking someone in the eye means that you are direct and respectful in some countries, yet, in other cultural systems, looking away is a sign of respect. The meanings we attach to symbols can create a cultural havoc when we meet someone who believes in a different meaning or interpretation; it can give us <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">culture shock</a><span class="glossdef">A state of distress or confusion experienced when an individual is unprepared for a cultural situation or environment.</span></span>. This shock can be disorientating, confusing, or surprising. It can bring on anxiety or nervousness, and, for some, a sense of losing control.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s03_p02">While training senior managers in a leadership program, the issue of the organization’s dress code came up in our conversation about differences. All the managers were in agreement that there was a dress code problem. It seemed to the managers that a couple of the employees were not abiding by the dress code policy. At this mid-size organization, the dress code was business casual, but a couple of the employees (the younger ones to be exact) came into work wearing t-shirts or dresses with thin straps. The managers were all confused as to why the dress code was so hard to follow for these two employees. It was obvious to them that business casual meant looking professional and neat, wearing clothes that were pressed and crisp. No matter how many times the dress code was explained to the staff, these two employees never changed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s03_p03">In the training, we deconstructed the issue to understand what was really at play. The managers recognized that the dress code of “business casual” could mean several things if not explicitly stated in the policy. In fact, one manager said, “We keep saying that business casual is common sense, but our idea of common sense could be completely different from that employee’s version of common sense.” They also discovered that they did not want to be so explicit as to name every article of clothing that employees could and could not wear. They felt that being explicit would take away the feeling or the symbol that the office was a casual and relaxed environment; having policies that dictated everything that someone could or could not do would symbolize a different type of working environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s10_s03_p04">As a result of this conversation, the managers recognized the tangible ways in which symbols are manifested in organizations. They became more mindful of the language and words used. They were more intentional about their behavior, now recognizing that each of their reactions or non-reactions is a symbol.</p>
