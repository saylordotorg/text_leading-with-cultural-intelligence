    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s08_p01">One of the things that can happen in the context of discussing culture is falling into the stereotypes and generalizations of a cultural group or norm. It is important to recognize the difference and the impact these factors have in cultural interactions. In general, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stereotypes</a><span class="glossdef">Statements and interpretations, usually negative, made about a group of people which limit that group to specific perspectives.</span></span> are negative statements and interpretations made about a group of people. Stereotypes, whether deemed positive or negative, place people into boxes and categories and limit them to those specific perspectives. A stereotype, such as “Asians are good at math,” does not provide the complete picture someone needs to understand the Asian culture or the differences between Asian cultures. Similarly, just because you meet a 70-year old who does not know how to use current technology, it does not mean that other individuals in that generation do not know how to use it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch02_s08_p02">By contrast, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">generalizations</a><span class="glossdef">Broad statements, either valid or faulty, that are based on facts, experiences, examples, or logic.</span></span> of cultures are broad statements based on facts, experiences, examples, or logic. There are two kinds of generalizations, valid and faulty, and it is your role to determine which generalizations have validity behind them. Broad characterization of cultural groups can serve as a framework for cultural interactions. For example, Hispanic societies have a high degree of machismo, or, in Middle Eastern cultures, women have a lesser status than men—these types of generalizations are helpful when engaging with people of those cultures. But in all cultural interactions, culturally intelligent leadership requires you to recognize that generalizations do not apply to everyone within a cultural group.</p>
