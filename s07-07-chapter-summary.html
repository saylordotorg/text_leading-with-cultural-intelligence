    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="moua_1.0-ch05_s07_l01">
        <li> Interactions within cultures are based on a person’s sense of efficacy, which is their belief about their abilities to perform what is required in new cultural settings.</li>
        <li> Culturally intelligent leaders have higher levels of self-efficacy. They look at challenges as opportunities, they are resilient and persistent in their pursuance of the goal, they have higher confidence levels, and they are committed to finding solutions.</li>
        <li> Individuals who have low self-efficacy have lower expectations of themselves in new cultural settings, they lose interest and commitment under duress, and they focus on doubts and negative outcomes.</li>
        <li> Emotional intelligence speaks to the importance of self-efficacy in leadership; it points out the critical role self-efficacy has on managing one’s emotions, adaptability, and optimism.</li>
        <li> Mindfulness brings about creativity and innovation. It takes leaders “out of their boxes” and gives them a new way of perceiving themselves, their abilities, and their world.</li>
        <li> Mindlessness comes about through repetitive behaviors. Mostly unconsciously, a state of mindlessness can lead to learned helplessness.</li>
        <li> Research has shown that you can improve your self-efficacy, and the chapter highlights areas for leadership development.</li>
